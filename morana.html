            <h2>Who is Morana?</h2>
            <p>Morana is the Slavic goddess of death, winter, and rebirth. She is associated with the harsh cold, the end of the harvest, and the transition between life and death. She symbolizes the cyclical nature of existence, as she dies at the end of winter and is reborn with the coming of spring.</p>
